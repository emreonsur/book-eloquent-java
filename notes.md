## What is JavaScript?

> 2026-11-26 Potsdam, Germany

Javascript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the *Netscape Navigator Browser*. It has made modern web applications possible—that is, applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action.

Javascript has almost nothing to do with the programming language *Java*. The name was inspired by marketing considerations. When JavaScript was being introduced, Java was gaining popularity, so that someone thought it was a good idea to try to ride along on this success.

After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standart document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript could make sure they actually provided the same language. The Ecma International organization conducted the standardization, and this is called the **ECMAScript standart**. ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably.

- **Operators**
